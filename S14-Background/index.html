        Jamshedji Nusserwanji Tata was born in 1839. Tata graduated from
        Elphinstone College in Bombay in 1858. Shortly afterwards, he joined his
        father's trading firm that dealt in general merchandise. There, the
        junior Tata took a special interest in developing trade with China. When
        the American Civil War caused a boom in the Bombay cotton market, Tata
        and his father joined the Asiatic Banking Corporation. When the tide
        ebbed, Tata's credit was left desolate. Fortunately, the firm's credit
        was re-established during the next three years. A share in the lucrative
        contract for the commissariat of Napier's expedition to Abyssinia in
        1868 restored the family fortune." In 1870 with Rs.21,000 capital, he
        founded a trading company.[9] Further, he bought a bankrupt oil mill at
        Chinchpokli and converted it into a cotton mill, under the name
        Alexandra Mill which he sold for a profit after two years. In 1874, he
        set up another cotton mill at Nagpur named Empress Mill. He dreamed of
        achieving four goals, setting up an iron and steel company, a unique
        hotel, a world-class learning institution, and a hydroelectric plant.
        During his lifetime, in 1903, the Taj Mahal Hotel at Colaba waterfront
        was opened making it the first hotel with electricity in British India.

        J. R. D. Tata was made chairman of the Tata Group in 1938. Under his
        chairmanship, the assets of the Tata Group grew from US$101 million to
        over US$5 billion. Starting with 14 enterprises, upon his departure half
        a century later in 1988, Tata Sons had grown to a conglomerate of 95
        enterprises. These enterprises consisted of ventures that the company
        had either started or in which they held a controlling interest. New
        sectors such as chemicals, technology, cosmetics, marketing,
        engineering, manufacturing, tea, and software services earned them
        recognition.[10] In 1932,[11] JRD founded an airline, known as Tata Air
        Services (later renamed Tata Airlines). In 1953, the Government of India
        passed the Air Corporations Act and purchased a majority stake in the
        carrier from Tata Sons, though JRD Tata would continue as chairman till
        1977. In 1945, Tata Motors was founded, first focused on locomotives. In
        1954, it entered the commercial vehicle market after forming a joint
        venture with Daimler-Benz. In 1968, Tata Consultancy Services was
        founded.

        In 1991, Ratan Tata became chairman of Tata Group.[12] This was also the
        year of economic liberalization in India, opening up the market to
        foreign competitors.[13] During this time, Tata Group began to acquire
        several companies. Tata Group bought Tetley In February 2000. After
        that, it acquired Corus Group in 2007. In the year 2008, it acquired
        Jaguar and Land Rover. The company's subsidiary Tata Motors launched the
        Tata Nano which they presented as "the world's most affordable car" in
        2008.

        In 2017, Natarajan Chandrasekaran was appointed chairman. He was
        instrumental in restructuring business verticals and increasing promoter
        stake ownership in companies. Under his leadership, the group made
        acquisitions through insolvency law and investments in E-commerce,
        expanded its airline business by winning a bid for Air India, and
        completely bought Air Asia India. He has mentioned the future strategy
        is to focus on healthcare, electronics, and digital.

        Tata Owned Air India got approval to acquire AirAsia India, nearly two
        months after putting forth the proposal. The Competition Commission of
        India (CCI) approved the acquisition of the entire shareholding in Air
        Asia India by Tata-owned Air India.
